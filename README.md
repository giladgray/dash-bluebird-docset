# Dash Bluebird Docset

> [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) docset for the excellent Dash documentation browser.

Bluebird is a fully featured promise library with focus on innovative features and performance. Its documentation is good and thorough but available only as a massive markdown file on GitHub. Not anymore!

## Installation
This docset will be available as a user-contributed Dash docset.

You can add it to Dash yourself by cloning and building via the instructions below, or by downloading a release archive from the Releases page.

## Development
Building this docset yourself is simple:

1. `npm install -g coffee-script` (if you haven't already)
2. `git clone` this repo
3. `npm install`
4. `coffee docset.coffee` to rebuild the Sqlite database

The Bluebird documentation Markdown file can be found in `html/`. I saved each of the files from the GitHub repo directly and modified them slightly to look better in Dash by removing the table of contents outline at the beginning.

Other Dash Docset files can be found in the `bluebird.docset` folder, such as `icon.png`, `Contents/Info.plist`, and `Contents/Resources/docSet.dsidx`.

The `docset.coffee` script compiles API.md to HTML, copies the necessary CSS files, and then reads the HTML file to find Section and Function headers and generates the `searchIndex` database table. It also injects table-of-contents anchors to the HTML files and writes them to `bluebird.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents`.
